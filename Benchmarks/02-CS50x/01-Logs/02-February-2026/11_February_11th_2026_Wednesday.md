# Problem set 2, day 6

### Not much was done today, but we only have the first 1 or 2 digit validation left.

### I Removed the printing of the checksum result. 
### I removed the printing of the card length
### I Re-learned about the significance of handing out the value of user input to other variables as to not taint the main value.
### I Added comments on the function of everything else .
### we validated the last digit of the checksum to check for `0` , if zero, okay, if not, invalid.
### I used logical operators in order to validate both the checksum and card length. and to print valid or invalid for now.

And , the code can be found [here](../../02-Problem-sets/Pset_2/credit/credit.c) and the readme [here](../../02-Problem-sets/Pset_2/readme.md).
