**C Operators & Logic Deep Dive**
1. **Arithmetic:** Mastered `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` (Modulus) for remainders and parity.
2. **Shorthand:** Used `x += n`, `x *= n`, `x++`, and `x--` to update variables efficiently.
3. **Boolean Truth:** C treats `0` as False and any non-zero as True; utilized `&&`, `||`, and `!`.
4. **The Pitfall:** Differentiated `=` (assignment/sets value) from `==` (equality/checks value).
5. **Implementation:** Applied these operators to refine control flow and conditional logic.
