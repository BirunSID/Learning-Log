# How I'm benchmarking myself:

## 1. I'm using [IELTStest](https://ieltsonlinetests.com/).
- By using this. im making sure to get a consistent desired score . which would be 8 or 8.5 , the site's purpose is to make the tests as hard as possible so that the real test would be easier. Then, im moving on to...

## 2. Cambridge books 
- I do 4 total tests on cambridge book 20 specifically, then i write down the scores and figure out my consistent score .

## dividing up the marks
- I then , divide each tests into as many parts as there is in the module and then separately mark them , then i figure out which one is constantly bringing my marks down .

## working on specific errors
-  Then I simply work on the part that is not going well, then im familiarizing myself with strategies and tricks/tips.

## mock test prep
- Im also preparing for the mock tests by quickly familiarizing myself with all 4 modules . so that when its time for mock test, I can do better. (Got admitted into speakers council for this. 10 mocks , 1 month validity)

## if mocks aren't enough
- I'll have to make sure i prioritize the module where I'm not getting much and make sure to score above 8.5 at any cost .
