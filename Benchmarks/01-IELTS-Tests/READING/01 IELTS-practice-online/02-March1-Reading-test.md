- **T/F/NG (3 Errors)**: You are still falling for "The Trap." If the text says "It may rain" and the question says "It will rain," the answer is False. If the text says nothing about rain, it is Not Given. You are likely still trying to use your own logic to "bridge" what the author meant. Stop. If it’s not on the paper, it doesn’t exist.
- **Part 3 MCQs (4 Errors):** This is your primary bottleneck. Part 3 is academic. The "Distractors" (wrong answers) will use the exact words from the text. The "Correct" answer will use synonyms.
The Fix: Do not look for the right answer. Look for the three wrong ones. Eliminate the "Distractors" that repeat text keywords but change the context.
