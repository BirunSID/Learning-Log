# IELTS Reading 01

**Score:** 28/40 (Band 6.5)  
**Error Map:** N/A (Aggregate score only)  
**Primary Issue:** Assumption bias. I made mistakes by guessing answers based on outside knowledge or grammar instead of what was actually written.  
**Improvement:** Stop predicting. Base every answer strictly on evidence found in the passage, ignoring personal knowledge.
