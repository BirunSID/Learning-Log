# IELTS Reading 03

**Score:** 36/40 (Band 8.0)  
**Trend:** +0.5 Band Improvement 📈  
**Error Map:** P1: 3 | P2: 0 | P3: 1  
**Primary Issue:** The "True/False/Not Given" bug. All 4 errors were in this category. I am still misinterpreting nuances in certainty (e.g., confusing "Most" with "All") and probability.  
**Improvement:** Halt full testing. Switch to targeted drills focusing solely on T/F/NG questions to fix the logic gap regarding quantity and specific wording.
