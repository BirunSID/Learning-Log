# IELTS Reading 02

**Score:** 33/40 (Band 7.5)  
**Trend:** +1.0 Band Improvement 📈  
**Error Map:** P1: 1 | P2: 1 | P3: 5  
**Primary Issue:** Part 3 bottleneck. I struggled with "True/False/Not Given" logic (using personal reasoning instead of text evidence) and fell for "distractor" answers in the multiple-choice section.  
**Improvement:** For T/F/NG: strict literal interpretation only. For MCQs: find the wrong answers first (elimination) and look for synonyms rather than matching keywords.
