**2. THE "TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN" BUG**
The Residual Error: All 4 of your current mistakes are in this specific category.
The Diagnosis: You are still struggling with Certainty vs. Probability.
The Fix: If the text says "Most people prefer X," and the question says "Everyone prefers X," the answer is FALSE (The quantity doesn't match). If the question says "People like X," the answer is NOT GIVEN (The text didn't discuss "liking," only "preference").
**Action:** For tomorrow's session, do not do a full test. Do a "Targeted Drill" of 20 T/F/NG questions only. Kill the bug.
