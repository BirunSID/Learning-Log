# IELTS Reading: Batch 1 Audit (Tests 1–4)

**Current Status:** Band 8.0 – 8.5 (Unstable)
**Aggregate Error Map:** P1: 3 | P2: 5 | P3: 13 (Critical 🚨)

**Failure Domain Analysis:**
• **Part 1:** Fundamentally mastered. Errors only appeared under extreme fatigue (Test 4).  
• **Part 2:** Generally stable. Minor losses come from overthinking implicit links, not skill gaps.  
• **Part 3:** Primary bottleneck. Repeated breakdowns due to complex academic logic, implicit meaning, and unexpected question patterns.

**Meta-Observation:**
My true reading level is closer to Band 8.5, but performance is volatile under fatigue and unfamiliar Part 3 structures.

**Strategic Pivot:**
Full-length Reading tests are no longer efficient.

**New Directive:**
Suspend general simulations. Shift to exclusive **Part 3 isolation drills** to stabilize Band 8.5 and remove volatility blocking Band 9.0.
