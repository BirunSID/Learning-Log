### **IELTS Reading: Benchmark 01**

**Score:** 35/40 | **Band:** 8.0 (Stabilized ✅)  
**Source:** Cambridge 20 — Test 1 (Computer-Based)

*   **The Breakdown:**
    *   **Part 1:** 0 Errors (Mastered)
    *   **Part 2:** 1 Error (Stable)
    *   **Part 3:** 4 Errors (Logical mismatches)

*   **Observation:** Band 8.0 is now my consistent baseline. Foundational skills and speed in Parts 1 and 2 are solid. The final jump to Band 9.0 is currently blocked by Section 3, where complex academic logic led to a few information mismatches.
