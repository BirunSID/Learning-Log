# IELTS Listening: Batch 1 Audit (Tests 1-4)

**Current Status:** Band 8.0 - 8.5
**Aggregate Error Map (Last 3 Tests):** P1: 1 | P2: 2 | P3: 3 | P4: 8 (Critical 🚨)

**Failure Domain Analysis:**
*   **Conversational:** Highly optimized. Multi-speaker tracking (P1/P3) is effectively error-free.
*   **Monologue:** Significant attrition in Part 4. The inability to sustain focus during long-form academic narratives is the sole barrier to a perfect score.

**Strategic Pivot:**
Full-length simulations are now inefficient.
**New Directive:** Halt general testing. Transition to exclusive **Part 4 Isolation Drills** to close the final 3-point gap to Band 9.0.
