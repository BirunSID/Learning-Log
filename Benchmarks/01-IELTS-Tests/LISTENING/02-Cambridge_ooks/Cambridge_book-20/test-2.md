# IELTS Listening 02

**Score:** 35/40 (Band 8.0)  
**Error Map:** P1: 0 | P2: 1 | P3: 2 | P4: 2  
**Primary Issue:** Performance attrition in academic sections. Social sections are stabilized, but errors shifted to higher-density technical content.  
**Improvement:** Increase exposure to long-form academic lectures to build concentration stamina for the test's second half.
