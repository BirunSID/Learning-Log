# IELTS Listening 04

**Score:** 35/40 (Band 8.0)  
**Error Map:** P1: 1 | P2: 0 | P3: 1 | P4: 3  
**Primary Issue:** Section 4 bottleneck. A consistent error pattern in the final academic lecture is currently the primary barrier to a Band 9.0.  
**Improvement:** Prioritize high-intensity drills for academic monologues and technical note-taking to plug the "leak" in the final 10 minutes.
