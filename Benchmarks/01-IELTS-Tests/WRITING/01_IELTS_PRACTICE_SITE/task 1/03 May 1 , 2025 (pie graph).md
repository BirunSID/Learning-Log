# The first try
```
The pie chart illustrates the UAE government budget distribution in the year 2000 with AED 315 billion.

It is apparent that the most amount of money is going towards the Social security and then Health & personal social services. Moreover, the least amount was spent on transportation.

We can see from the pie chart that, a total of AED 100 billion was spent on Social security. Then, at second place, it's Health and personal services which takes AED 53 billion. Afterwards, it's Education, consuming 38 billion AED. Later, we notice something odd in "Other expenditure" and "Debt interest". Both of these takes the exact same amount of budget which is AED 23 billion.

Regarding the next 5 which are at the bottom of the account. Defence takes about AED 22 billion. Next up, Law and order is allocated 17 billion. Subsequently, "Housing the heritage & Environment" and "Industry & Agriculture & Employment" is granted AED 15 billion and 13 billion respectively. Finally, Transportation budget is only AED 9 billion.
