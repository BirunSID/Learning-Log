# The first try

The diagram illustrates a process about recycling organic waste to create garden fertilizer.

Overall, it is evident that the container must have a number of narrow holes in its body for proper airflow. Moreover, there are specific steps to watch out for, such as, using hot water only and nitrogen, then letting it sit for approximately 6 months before using in gardens.

At first, a plastic container of 2 cubic metre is required with pores for airflow. Next, at the bottom, food items are placed, taking 15 cm from the bottom. afterwards, grass is placed on top of the food taking the same space as before from the bottom. Then, we place a newspaper and throw the wastes on it.

Following this, hot water and nitrogen are added and the opening is sealed. Later, the heat dissipates through the narrow holes in the container. Finally, the container is left for 6 months to turn into compost and is ready to be used in gardens.
