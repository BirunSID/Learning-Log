The chart presents global population percentages and wealth distribution of several regions.

Overall, North America has relatively low population than most but possesses the significant amount of global wealth out of all regions. Additionally, only three regions have more wealth than their population percentage: North America, Europe and Rich Asia-Pacefic. Other regions have the opposite figure with some similarities in data.

Regarding the highest wealth possessor, North America comes out on top with only around 5% of the population, they have a very high wealth distribution at around 35%. Moving on, Europe has around 15% populace with approximately 30% of all global wealth. Then, at third place, it is the Rich Asia-Pacefic region with 5% population and has around 25% of global riches.

If we take a look at the regions with the opposite trait of wealth to population ratio, we can find China at around 25% of the global populace but possessing only around half of 5%. This is also true for "Other Asia Pacefic" regions but they are at around 15% population. Subsequently, India also has the same percentage of population as "Other Asia-Pacefic" but has around less than 5% of global resources. Africa also possesses the same as India but has just 10% population. Latin America & Caribean region is doing comparatively better with a little more than 5% of wealth and a population at around 5%.
