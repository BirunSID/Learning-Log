# The first try:

The graph illustrates the amount of girls per 100 boys studying in different grades of school education , in 1990 and 1998 for both developing and developed countries around the globe.

There was not much difference between 1990 and 1998 for both types of countries in case of primary education. but the gap widened when compared in terms of secondary education with the developed countries almost touching the target ceiling. The contrast further increased by a massive number in Tertiary education with the developed countries already above the target requirements and the developing countries far away from it.

Firstly in 1990, for primary education, developing countries were at 83 when developed countries were at 95. But this didnt change much even in 1998. The developing one's went to 87 and the developed ones to 96. However , when looking at Secondary education stats, we can clearly see that even though the 3rd world countries went from 72 to 82, the developed countries almost reached the goal at 98 and 99 respectively for 1990 and 1998 .

Then, at last, In terms of Tertiary education, the developing countries made improvements and went from 66 to 75 but still were behind by a large margin in contrast to the developed countries who already surpassed the goal in 1990 at 105 and further enhanced to 112 in 1998. The gap here is relatively more than the other two education grades.

# The perfected one:

```
The graph depicts the number of girls per 100 boys in different stages of school education and comparison between developed nations and their developing counterparts for both 1990 and 1998.

It is apparent that the trend for girls enrollment is rising in every levels of study for both type of states. However, it is also noticeable that the developing countries are lagging behind the sophisticated ones by a  huge margin as the level of education gets higher.

The developing states went from 83 to 87 in terms of primary education whilst the other party were at 95 and jumped only by 1 in 1998. Unlike before, there is now a slight gap between the 2 types of countries when compared on Secondary education. The developing countries were at 72 but increased it to 82 in 1998. The developed states almost reached the goal in 1990 at 98 girls and just as before. only saw an increment by 1 in 1998.

However, The Contrast grew even more in Tertiary education with the developed countries far surpassing the goal of 100 , at 105 in 1990 and climbing to 112 in 1998. The developing countries were only at 66 in 1990 and increased to 75 in 1998 which was far behind the target number and subsequently the developed nations.
