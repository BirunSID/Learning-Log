The graph illustrates the oil extraction and usage daily , in China , from 1982 to 2006.

It is apparent that the production has remained static whereas the consumption has been rising sharply. This suggests that the supply is unable to keep up with the growing consumer market.

At first , we can notice that the line representing production rose from 2 million barrel per day in 1982 to 3 million in 1986 and has remained stable till 1994. However, Supply climbed up slightly in the same year and have been steadily increasing till 2006. But the production was unable to go above the demand.

If we move on to the line indicating consumption, we can notice a stagnant state between 1982 and 1990. This was below the production line then. But soon afterwards, The consumption increased by a huge margin, above 3 million barrels in 1994 which surpassed the oil supply. This trend has continued since and is only rising upwards as recorded till 2006.

The graph illustrates the extraction of oil and consumption daily, in china, from 1982 to 2006.

As we can notice , the production was relatively steady whilst the consumption rose exponentially over time surpassing the supply by a significant margin. This suggests that the production line is unable to keep up with the consumer market.

Initially, If we look at the line representing production, we can observe that the supply went from 2 million barrels per day in 1982 to 3 million in 1986. This was a significant rise in production . Since then, the line remained stagnant until 1994. Just before this year, demand surpassed supply but going forth, there was a modest increase from 3 million barrels to about somewhere between 3 and 4 million containers per day.

Finally, if we turn to the line indicating consumption, there was a steady demand from 1982 till 1990 which was at 2 million barrels/day. Then, a slight fluctuation was seen from 1990 to 1994 when the demand went above the production line. Since then, usage has been rising very sharply and with a line, relatively more curved than it's counterpart.
