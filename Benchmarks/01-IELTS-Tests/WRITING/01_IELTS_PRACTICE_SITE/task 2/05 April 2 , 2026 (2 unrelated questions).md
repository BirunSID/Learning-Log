# The first try
```
People opine frequently about creating an utopian society but mostly fails to achieve so. I believe it is possible to create an ideal society and it will require a large portion of the population to be committed to acquire such a feat.

Regarding my opinion, I think it is quite possible to create an ideal society. The definition of an ideal society varies across time and geological location. However, my definition would be "A society governed by strict laws which are respected by the people and followed by most and is beneficial for the masses". This is a simple and straight-forward definition because, in an ideal society, laws lead the people and are woven into the society to help the people.

As for how we can create an ideal society, first, we need to unite the general people. We need the help and effort of not just the politicians but the entire population because everyone needs to do their part and reap the benefits of an ideal society. Furthermore, education should be mandatory for everyone and it does not necessarily have to be academic. Education on Civic sense and other ideas can improve the external outline of the society. Finally, as for internal development, we need constitutional reforms because they are outdated and are loathed by the majority middle class and below beccause it does not benefit except the politicians and those in power.

In conclusion, an ideal society is one where everyone is united and willing to create a better future for the next generation. In order to achieve so, we need massive structural and systematic reforms in all sectors.

People opine frequently about creating a utopian society but mostly fail to achieve so. I would define it as a framework that has strict laws governing the populace with high compliance rate and it will require a large portion of the population to be committed to achieve such a feat.

Regarding my opinion, firstly, the definition would be "A society governed by strict laws which are respected by the people and followed by most and are beneficial for the masses". This is a simple and straight-forward because, in an ideal society, laws lead the people and are woven into the society to help the people. Moreover, I think that it is worth a try and even if we fail to properly reach such a status, we can reach a relatively better society than the one at present.
