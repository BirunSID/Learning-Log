A number of people thinks that physical strength is vital for success in sport, whilst another party opines that mental strength is more significant. I believe that, even though, physical strength is mandatory for good performance, mental strength is more vital in sport due to various factors.

One group believes that physical strength is important for success in sport and they are right about it to some extent. Nearly all high performing and successful athletes are in peak human physiology and they have to maintain this through rigorous training all year. Without developing a strong body through physical exercise, no athlete can succeed. As we can see from the Olympics, FIFA and the International tournaments around the globe, all the athletes possess a strong body and this power led them to become victorious. For example, Ronaldo would never have become such a high performing football player if he was not physically adept. Undoubtedly, physical strength is indeed vital in sport.

On the contrary, another group thinks that mental strength is more significant than physical strength. This argument is more stronger because without the Will-power to endeavor on such a difficult task is near impossible. If an athlete does not have the spirit to train and practice consistently for 12 months to attain high gains, then he will give up just a few months later. There are many examples of athletes who quit midway because of the pressure they undergo during training or even the main play. For example, an athlete who does not have the mental capacity to train all day and maintain a strict diet to curve his body fat, will never be able to perform as good as someone who has been doing the opposite for a year even if the first athlete was relatively in better shape prior to the play.

In conclusion, both physical and mental strengths are necessary for success in sport. However, it is through mental fortitude, that one gains the willingness to do what it takes to boost his physique beyond the limits. As a result, mental strength weights heavier compared to physical strength. Thus, my opinion is that mental strength is far more vital than physical strength.
