# The first try
```
A number of people opines that news holds no connection to ones life and thus, it is not wise to spend time in reading newspapers and watching TV news channels. I completely disagree with this view because of two logical reasons: 1. news are almost, always relevant and 2. people should be aware of the actions and incidents that happen around the world to understand their surrondings and themselves, better.

The first reasoning is that what goes around comes around. It means that what happens on one side of the country will affect another side sooner or later. For example, if there is a flood happening in the capital city of Dhaka, the supply lines and logistics of almost every product on the market from tech to food will be blocked or inaccessible and afterwards, in other parts of the country of Bangladesh such as Chittagong or Rajshahi, prices of necessary goods will rise. So, a family in Chittagong cannot state that the news of flood in Dhaka is irrelevant to them.

Regarding the second reason, it is wise to be aware of what happens around us. In short, we cannot prevent a negative outcome of a vector if we were never aware of it in the first place. Suppose, a crooked politician was caught laundering money in London. If the people of London were unaware of this scandal at that time, then, 5 years later, this same man could run for the position of mayor and people would vote for him, unaware of the evil acts he committed prior to the election. But, if only one person saw the news then and was aware of this, he could let others know and the people of the city could choose not to elect this evil and save themselves. So, reading newspapers or watching TV news programs could help in establishing awareness that has very good advantages.

In conclusion, the opinion that news has to connection to the lives of people and should be avoided from being read by anyone is illogical. Most of the time, news are relevant and the incident may affect everyone. Furthermore, being aware can help us in many ways. Thus, I disagree with this view.

A number of people opine that news holds no connection to one's life and thus, it is not wise to spend time in reading newspapers and watching TV news channels. I completely disagree with this view because of two logical reasons: 1. news is almost, always relevant and 2. people should be aware of the actions and incidents that happen around the world to understand their surroundings and themselves, better.

The first reasoning is that every action and incidents are somehow connected to one another. It means that what happens on one side of the country will affect another side sooner or later. For example, if there is a flood happening in the capital city of Dhaka, the supply lines and logistics of almost every product on the market from tech to food will be blocked or inaccessible and afterwards, in other parts of the country of Bangladesh such as Chittagong or Rajshahi, prices of necessary goods will rise. So, a family in Chittagong cannot state that the news of the flood in Dhaka is irrelevant to them.

Regarding the second reason, it is wise to be aware of what happens around us. In short, society cannot prevent a negative outcome of a vector if the community was never aware of it in the first place. Suppose, a crooked politician was caught laundering money in London. If the people of London were unaware of this scandal at that time, then, 5 years later, the same man could run for the position of mayor and people would vote for him, unaware of the evil acts he committed prior to the election.
