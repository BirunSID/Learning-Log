At first, we can notice that the graph is mostly filled with Australian natives at 73%. At second place, it is the people from "other" countries at 14%. The rest including UK, New Zealand, China and Netherlands are in the minority at 7%, 3%, 2% and 1% respectively.

However, unlike the natives or any other nationalities, almost all the Chinese live in urban areas with only 1% in countryside.
