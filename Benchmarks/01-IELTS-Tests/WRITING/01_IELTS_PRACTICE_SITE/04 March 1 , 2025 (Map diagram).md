# The first try
```
The map illustrates the layout of a bookstore from two time, year 2000 and the present.

It is clearly apparent that the massive space previously allocated for "Fiction" has been occupied by rooms dedicated to other genre and the second Fiction section is completely removed. Furthermore, there are new additions: a cafe and a few tables.

If we take a look at the entrance and the sections nearby such as "Travel", "New books" and a "Service Desk" from 2000, we can notice that they have remained unchanged. However, if we go a bit further, the 3 sections of Art, Hobbies and Cookery, they seem to have been moved up to where the big section of Fiction was previously in, squeezing fiction forward in a relatively much smaller space as compared to before.

Regarding the rest of the changes, we can observe that there was another section dedicated to Fiction in 2000 which is now removed and its space occupied by Non-Fiction at present. Moreover, there are now 3 tables in the same place as Art, Hobbies and Cookery with a new cafe in place of Non-Fiction.

# The perfected one:
```
The map illustrates the internal layout of a bookstore that have underwent changes between two time periods, year 2000 and present.

Overall, the large Fiction section in the North have been ruduced and squeezed North-East. Furthermore, besides the unchanged structures in the west, it is apparent that the second Fiction section was replaced by its counter-part in the East and new additions were made, such as the cafe and tables.

Regarding the western section, the entrance, Travel, New books and Service Desk has remained today as it was in 2000. However, if we take a look at the center, the Art, Hobbies and Cookery were moved towards the North-West and now occupies much of the space that the Northern Fiction segment once possessed. Consequently, the fiction section was squeezed towards the North-East.

If we observe the rest of the structures, in the East, the second fiction section was removed and replaced by the Non-fiction zone that was located in the South, in 2000. At the center, where the three vertical structures of Art, Hobbies and Cookery once existed, is now taken by three new tables. Subsequently, in place of the former Southern Non-fiction room, there is now a new cafe.

# Important issue: subject verb agreement issue!


# Gemini perfected version:
```
The maps illustrate the structural transformations of a bookstore from 2000 to the present day.

Overall, the bookstore has transitioned from a purely retail space to one that incorporates social facilities. While the western section remains largely unchanged, the central and eastern areas have undergone significant reorganization, characterized by the downsizing of the fiction department and the addition of a cafe and seating.

Regarding the features that remained static, the entrance, the "Travel" and "New books" sections, and the service desk in the southwestern corner have not been altered. However, the northern wall, which was formerly occupied entirely by Fiction, now houses Art, Hobbies, and Cookery. Consequently, the Fiction section has been relocated to the northeastern corner and significantly reduced in size.

In the center of the store, the vertical shelves for Art, Hobbies, and Cookery have been replaced by three tables and chairs. Furthermore, the large "Non-fiction" area at the bottom has been repurposed into a cafe, while the Non-fiction department itself has been moved to the eastern wall, taking the place of the smaller Fiction section from 2000.
